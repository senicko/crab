An implementation of the 'Monkey' language from 'Writing an interpreter in Go' by Thorsten Ball but written in rust thus called 'Crab'. I am new to Rust and I have no idea how to write idiomatic Rust code (yet) so if you have somehow encounterd this repo, and spent your time looking at my code for some reason, feel free to leave some suggestions in an issue.
